0x09. Island Perimeter

conditional logic to solve a geometric problem within a grid context. The goal is to calculate the perimeter of a single island in a grid, where the grid is represented by a 2D array of integers. Understanding how to navigate and analyze 2D arrays and apply logical operations to determine the conditions for perimeter calculation is crucial for this task.

Concepts Needed:
2D Arrays (Matrices):

Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).
Conditional Logic:

Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.
Counting Techniques:

Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the islandâ€™s perimeter.
Problem-Solving Strategies:

Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.
Python Programming:

## Nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
A nested list comprehension is a powerful way to create complex lists in Python. It involves having a list comprehension within another list comprehension. This allows you to build lists based on multiple loops or conditions.
